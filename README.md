# Epilepsy Journey — Scripts & Snippets

Welcome to the **Epilepsy Journey Scripts & Snippets** repository. 🌐✨  
This is our digital toolbox — a collection of small but mighty helpers that keep the Epilepsy Journey site running smoothly.  

Not every piece of code needs a full plugin or standalone project. Some are quick fixes, style patches, or utility functions. This repo gives them a proper home so they’re versioned, documented, and ready for reuse.

## 🔧 What You’ll Find Here
- **PHP functions** — lightweight helpers and WordPress/LMS adjustments  
- **JavaScript snippets** — UI fixes, interactivity, and workflow improvements  
- **CSS tweaks** — styling consistency and layout adjustments  
- **One-off utilities** — small scripts that solve specific problems

## 🚀 Why This Repo?
Epilepsy Journey is an evolving platform. As we iterate, we discover gaps best solved with tiny, targeted code snippets. Instead of scattering them across themes, plugins, or sticky notes, we collect them here for clarity and collaboration.  

This repo helps us:
- Keep snippets version-controlled  
- Share solutions across the team  
- Reuse code instead of reinventing it  
- Maintain consistency and stability
